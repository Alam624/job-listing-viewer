# Job Listing Viewer

Super simple Job Listing Viewer web app that allows you to browse, filter and sort between jobs. You 
also add, edit and deletes notes for each job. My main goal when building this project was just to learn about fullstack development and get my hands dirty while making a fullstack web app myself. There are many major improvements that (should) could be implemented that I will address further below.




## Demo

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Bootstrap

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB


## Installation

To install my project locally:

1. Open terminal to clone repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Alam624/job-listing-viewer.git
```
2. ```cd``` into the directory then ```cd``` into client folder then run
```bash
  npm install
```
3. To run the project
```bash
  npm start
```

NOTE: You will have to change <password> in the .env file to the password of the database 
if you want to run locally.


## Why MongoDB?

It was simply just the most popular NoSQL DB that I found
## More about this project

This was my first project that I built using React, and also my first time building a fullstack webapp.
Learning all the new technologies at the same time was definitely not a good decision, and I will be taking things one at 
a time from now on...

Though it was quite overwhelming I must say that I did still learn a lot. 

While the primary goal was to simply get everything functioning,
there are some serious improvements that should be made:

1.  Everything is everywhere
*  Next time I need to start with better folder structure, it would help with scalability as well

2. The site is ugly
*  It could really use some better styling

3. Notes are just strings
*  Next time I would like to have the notes as separate documents in the database

4. Get better at functional programming and actually follow its rules
* Pretty self explanatory
